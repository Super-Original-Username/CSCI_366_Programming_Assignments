# CSCI 466 PA1 - Basic Battleship Game

I'm editing this readme purely for the sake of ensuring that test is run from the correct directory.

There is a good chance that you are already aware of this, but it's far better to be safe then sorry. When run from the main project directory, i.e. calling the test executable as `./test/battleship_tests`, nearly all of the tests fail. When calling from **within** the test directory, all tests run and pass as expected. I'm quite inexperienced with c++ and cmake in general, so it may be that this is normal behavior.
